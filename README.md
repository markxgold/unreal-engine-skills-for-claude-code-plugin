# Unreal MCP Plugin for Claude Code

Control Unreal Editor directly from Claude Code via MCP. Hundreds of tools exposed via EDA's ToolsetRegistry across 30+ toolsets: actors, blueprints, materials, Niagara, Control Rigs, State Trees, widgets, Gameplay Ability System, and more.

## Prerequisites

1. **Unreal Editor** with the **ModelContextProtocol** and **ClaudeCode** plugins enabled
2. **Editor running** - the MCP server starts automatically (or on first Claude Code tab open)

## Installation

Add the plugin path to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["/path/to/unreal-mcp-plugin"]
}
```

Or in a Claude Code session, run:

```
/install-plugin /path/to/unreal-mcp-plugin
```

## Verification

1. Launch Unreal Editor, open **Tools > Claude Code** to start the MCP server
2. Check the Output Log for MCP server startup messages
3. In Claude Code, run `/mcp`. You should see `unreal-mcp` listed as a connected server
4. Try: "List all actors in the current level"

## Configuration

The default port is **8000** with URL path `/mcp`. If the port is in use, run `ModelContextProtocol.StartServer <port>` in the console with a different port number. The ClaudeCode plugin writes `.mcp.json` automatically on startup with the correct URL.

## Security

The MCP server runs on **localhost only** with origin validation. This is appropriate for local development.

## What's Available

All tools are auto-discovered by Claude Code via MCP. No manual configuration needed. Tools cover the full editor surface across these domains:
